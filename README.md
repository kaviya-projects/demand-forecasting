ENHANCING SUPERMARKET INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
THROUGH ARIMA AND SARIMAX - BASED DEMAND FORECASTING

Abstract:
Employing time series analysis, particularly the
Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model
and its seasonal extension, Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated
Moving Average with Exogenous Variables (SARIMAX), the
study aims to estimate demand for various retail commodities.
The dataset includes past and present product sales information
from a supermarket, spanning from 2015 to 2018, which is used
to predict future demand. Accurate demand forecasting is
essential for effective inventory management and strategic
decision-making in the retail sector. By taking seasonality and
external influences into account, SARIMAX improves the
model's capacity to identify complex patterns and trends in time
series data. Our project provides forecasts and evaluates their
accuracy using Mean Squared Error (MSE) calculations and
time series cross-validation. The primary dataset, which focuses
on a variety of retail products, provides a wealth of historical
insights. The initiative aims to deliver accurate demand
forecasts to support inventory optimization and informed
business decisions. The accuracy of these projections is
rigorously assessed using various evaluation techniques,
including time series cross-validation and MSE estimates. The
model's ability to adapt to seasonal variations and external
demand drivers is further enhanced by incorporating
SARIMAX, making it a robust tool for retail demand
forecasting.
